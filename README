Debian installer CD for PC Engines APU board with mSATA drive
=============================================================

Introduction
------------

This is a set of configuration files for building a Debian installation
CD optimized for the APU platform of PC Engines:
http://www.pcengines.ch/apu.htm

This installation is only intended for an mSATA drive on the APU
board. If you plan to boot from SD card, use Voyage Linux instead:
http://linux.voyage.hk/

The build machine can be Debian Wheezy of amd64 or i386 architecture.

Before using these scripts, have a look at the files in profiles/, and
you may want to change some options.

The default hostname is set to "apu", unless DHCP delivers a different
name.

The disk layout does not allocate a swap partition (the APU board has 2
or 4GB RAM). If you need swap, you can add a swapfile in root
partition. The system is optimized for minimal swap usage:
vm.swappiness=1 in /etc/sysctl.d/pcengines_apu.conf

The profile adds an hourly cronjob
(/etc/cron.hourly/pcengines_apu.fstrim) which performs fstrim command on
root and boot partitions once a day.

Installation
------------

WARNING: this is a fully automated installation. Once you boot from the
USB stick, it will only give you 5 seconds in the initial menu, and the
rest will be done automatically, and a new Debian system will be
installed on mSATA SSD drive.

!!! ALL EXISTING DATA ON THE DRIVE WILL BE LOST !!!

Build the CD image on the build machine:

## install prerequisites
apt-get update
apt-get install -y simple-cdd git

## get our latest files
mkdir /opt/pcengines
cd /opt/pcengines
git clone https://github.com/ssinyagin/pcengines-apu-debian-cd.git .

## build the installation CD image
build-simple-cdd --conf profiles/apu.conf --dist wheezy --force-root

## insert the USB stick into the build machine

## check where your USB stick is
fdisk -l

## copy the installer CD image
dd if=images/debian-7.4-i386-CD-1.iso of=/dev/sdc bs=1M

## insert the USB stick into APU board and connect the serial terminal
## The terminal emulator should be vt220 or xterm (vt100 does not have
## F12).  When the prompt for F12 appears, press F12 and select your USB
## stick as boot source.

## In the boot menu, "Install" will do automatic installation.

## ignore the error message and wait 30 seconds. I did not yet manage to
##   go around it:
Undefined video mode number: 314
Press <ENTER> to see video modes available, <SPACE> to continue, or wait 30 sec

## The installation continues, and you will get a new system within a
## couple of minutes. The APU will automatically reboot after the
## installation.
