Debian installer CD for PC Engines APU board with mSATA drive
=============================================================

Introduction
------------

This is a set of configuration files for building a Debian installation
CD optimized for the APU platform of PC Engines:
http://www.pcengines.ch/apu.htm

This installation is only intended for an mSATA drive on the APU
board. If you plan to boot from SD card, use Voyage Linux instead:
http://linux.voyage.hk/

The build machine can be Debian Wheezy of amd64 or i386 architecture.

Before using these scripts, have a look at the profiles/apu.* files, and
you may want to change some options. Create your own profile name in
this case.

The default hostname is set to "apu", unless DHCP delivers a different
name.

The default disk layout does not allocate a swap partition (the APU
board has 2 or 4GB RAM).

The partition layout in profiles/apu.preseed contains the option
"discard" for the root filesystem, but this option is first supported in
partman-ext3 version 79. Wheezy has version 74, so you need to edit
/etc/fstab manually. The next release, Jessie, will support the discard
option.

Installation
------------

Build the CD image on the build machine:

## install prerequisites
apt-get update
apt-get install -y simple-cdd git

## get our latest files
mkdir /opt/pcengines
cd /opt/pcengines
git clone https://github.com/ssinyagin/pcengines-apu-debian-cd.git .

## build the installation CD image
build-simple-cdd --profiles apu --dist wheezy --force-root

## insert the USB stick into the build machine

## check where your USB stick is
fdisk -l

## copy the installer CD image
dd if=images/debian-7.4-i386-CD-1.iso of=/dev/sdc bs=1M

## insert the USB stick into APU board and connect the serial terminal
## The terminal emulator should be vt220 or xterm (vt100 does not have
## F12).  When the prompt for F12 appears, press F12 and select your USB
## stick as boot source.



TO DO
-----

The build procedure for Jessie fails, need to figure out why:
 build-simple-cdd --profiles apu --dist jessie  --force-root
