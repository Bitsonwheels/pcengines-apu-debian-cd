Debian installer CD for PC Engines APU board with mSATA drive
=============================================================

Introduction
------------

This is a set of configuration files for building a Debian installation
CD optimized for the APU platform of PC Engines (www.pcengines.ch).

The build machine can be Debian Wheezy of amd64 or i386 architecture.

Before using these scripts, have a look at the profile/apu.* files, and
you may want to change some options. Create your own profile name in
this case.

Installation
------------

Build the CD image on the build machine:

## install prerequisites
apt-get update
apt-get install -y simple-cdd git

## get our latest files
mkdir /opt/pcengines
cd /opt/pcengines
git clone https://github.com/ssinyagin/pcengines-apu-debian-cd.git .

## build the CD (may take a while)
build-simple-cdd --profiles apu --dist wheezy --force-root 

## insert the USB stick into the build machine

## check where your USB stick is
fdisk -l

## copy the installer CD image
dd if=images/debian-7.4-i386-CD-1.iso of=/dev/sdc bs=1M

## insert the USB stick into APU board and connect the serial terminal
## The terminal emulator should be vt220 or xterm (vt100 does not have
## F12).  When the prompt for F12 appears, press F12 and select your USB
## stick as boot source.
